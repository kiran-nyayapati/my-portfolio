            <h2>How to become happier in times of distress?</h2>

            <p class="main-text">
                The term happiness is used in the context of mental or emotional states, including positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. It is also used in the context of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, eudaimonia, flourishing and well-being.<br>
                Since the 1960s, happiness research has been conducted in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including gerontology, social psychology and positive psychology, clinical and medical research and happiness economics.
                'Happiness' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning, and on possible differences in understanding by culture.

            <h2>How to get financial freedom in your 20s?</h2>

            <p class="main-text">
                If your current savings plan is waiting until the end of the month to squirrel away $50 of leftover cash, it’s time to re-think your approach. Regardless of how often you’re paid, it’s important you treat your savings like a non-negotiable bill. By paying yourself at the beginning of your pay cycle you’ll avoid the traps of overspending and will be more likely to gain traction and grow your savings successfully over time. <br>
                Take the guess work out of savings by setting up automated payments that distribute funds into clearly defined accounts, one for long term savings (like a saving for a home or starting a family) and the other for short term savings (like your next trip to Europe or that luxe pair of shoes you’ve been eyeing off for months). <br>
                “Our mantra for cashflow is automation and segregation, so segregate your accounts and automate your payments to each of them,” tells Brady.<br>
                Taking the time to pin point and understand your personal goals will help you select the right investment path to suit your needs.
